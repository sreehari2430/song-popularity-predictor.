🎵 Advanced Song Popularity Predictor
📋 Overview
The Advanced Song Popularity Predictor is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the popularity of songs on a scale of 1 to 10. Using key audio features like acousticness, danceability, tempo, and more, this tool leverages a Random Forest Classifier to provide accurate predictions.

An interactive Streamlit GUI allows users to input song attributes and instantly receive popularity predictions.

🛠️ Features
Random Forest Classifier with a streamlined ML pipeline.
Data preprocessing: Scaling, outlier handling, and oversampling for balanced predictions.
Feature importance visualization.
Interactive GUI built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.
Supports key features such as acousticness, loudness, and tempo for predictive analysis.
🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git  
cd <your-repo-name>  
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
3. Run the Streamlit App
Start the app locally:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py  
This will open the app in your default web browser.

📊 Input Features
The following features are used to predict song popularity:

Song Duration (ms): Total duration of the song in milliseconds.
Acousticness: Measure of the acoustic sound level in the track (0.0–1.0).
Danceability: Suitability of the track for dancing (0.0–1.0).
Liveness: Presence of an audience in the recording (0.0–1.0).
Loudness (dB): Overall volume of the track in decibels.
Tempo (BPM): Tempo of the song in beats per minute.
Audio Valence: Reflects the musical positivity or mood (0.0–1.0).
